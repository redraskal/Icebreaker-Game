# Icebreaker-Game

If you want to build this for some reason:
1. Download this fun repository
2. Install NodeJS (if you haven't yet)
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm install electron-packager'
5. Type electron-packager . in the game's root directory! :D
* If Step 5 doesn't work properly, try installing electron-builder (https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder)
